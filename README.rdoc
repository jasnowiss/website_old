== My Website

This is the repository of the personal website for Jeffrey Snowiss.

Made with the Rails framework and deployed to Heroku. A Bootstrap template was used as a base, and modified to produce the current layout.

Hosted at http://jeffsnowiss.com. Check it out to learn more about me, my projects, and my experience.
